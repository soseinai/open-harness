# Changelog

All notable changes to the open-harness workspace crates are tracked here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
the project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
once the v1.0 release gate (see `docs/remaining-work.md` §5 — M4) is reached.

Event-schema changes are tracked separately in [CHANGELOG-schema.md](./CHANGELOG-schema.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- M1a minimum-viable agent (commit `eb4b03c`): 7 workspace crates (`oharness-core`,
  `oharness-llm`, `oharness-providers`, `oharness-tools`, `oharness-memory`,
  `oharness-trace`, `oharness-loop`). `ReactLoop` with Anthropic `complete()`
  provider, `bash` + `fs` tools, three memory policies (`Passthrough`,
  `TruncateAfterTokens`, `ElideToolResults`), `FileSink` / `InMemorySink` /
  `FanOutSink` trace sinks, and JSONL trajectory reader.
- Design spec at `docs/open-harness-plan.md` and M1b+ handover at
  `docs/remaining-work.md` (commit `f035de8`).
- Repo hygiene: `rustfmt.toml`, `justfile` (`just ci`), this changelog, and
  `CHANGELOG-schema.md`.
- **M1b-α**: `AnthropicLlm::stream()` implemented via a hand-rolled Server-Sent
  Events parser (no new runtime dependency — only `wiremock` added as a
  dev-dep for the fixture-backed integration tests). Anthropic events
  (`message_start`, `content_block_{start,delta,stop}`, `message_delta`,
  `message_stop`, `ping`, `error`) translate to `Chunk` variants; unknown
  event types and delta types (e.g. `signature_delta`) pass through as
  `Chunk::Raw { provider: "anthropic", .. }`. `LlmCapabilities::streaming`
  flips to `true`. 15 SSE/decoder unit tests and 3 mocked-endpoint
  integration tests (chunk sequence, `complete()` vs. `complete_from_stream`
  round-trip, capability flag).
